# Tribune Publishing Omniture plugin

This is a simple plugin used for configuring Omniture metrics on Tribune publishing WordPress sites.

## Configuring

In order to configure this plugin, you should visit the settings page. There is a link on the plugins page, or in the Settings menu in the regular WordPress dropdown. You need to fill out each one of these fields in order for the Omniture tags to render properly on the front end.

Visit our [documentation website](http://docs.tribapps.com/analytics.html) to find more information on the variables that will be generated for the Omniture JavaScript object.
